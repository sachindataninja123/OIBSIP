        <p>
          <b>A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</b> , also known as India's Missile Man, was an
          Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th
          president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born on 15 October 1931 in
          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he specialized in physics and aeronautical
          engineering. Kalam spent four decades as a scientist and science
          administrator at the Defence Research and Development Organisation
          (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), playing a
          pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile
          development efforts. He was instrumental in the development of
          India's nuclear and missile programs, including the Pokhran-II
          nuclear tests in 1998. After his presidency, Kalam resumed civilian
          life, engaging in teaching, writing, and public service. Some of his
          notable works include "Wings of Fire," "India 2020 - A Vision for
          the New Millennium," "My Journey," and "Ignited Minds - Unleashing
          the Power Within India," which have become household names in India
          and among Indian nationals abroad.
